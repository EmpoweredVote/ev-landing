# Brand Assets

Source-of-truth logo, symbol, and favicon files for the Empowered Vote product suite.
Served statically at `/brand/<product>/...` (see `render.yaml`).

## Layout

Each product follows the same structure:

```
brand/<product>/
├── Favicon/
│   ├── ICO/    favicon .ico files (light/dark where available)
│   └── PNG/    16–512px favicon PNGs
├── Logo/
│   ├── PNG/    400w / 800w / 1200w / 2400w wordmark PNGs
│   └── SVG/    scalable wordmark
└── Symbol/
    ├── PNG/    64–1024px icon-mark PNGs
    └── SVG/    scalable icon mark
```

## Products

| Folder             | Product          | Dark/Light |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| `compass/`         | Compass          | both       |
| `essentials/`      | Essentials       | both       |
| `read-and-rank/`   | Read & Rank      | both       |
| `treasury-tracker/`| Treasury Tracker | logo only (favicon & symbol are single-color) |

## Site usage

The landing page product **cards** (`index.html`) use hand-tuned symbol copies in
`icons/` — cropped so the marks align consistently in the card grid. Those are the
live glyphs; the files here are the untouched source of truth. Sync any card change
back to the tuned `icons/` versions rather than pointing cards at these directly.

## Notes

- **Compass dark variant** — the brand pack shipped no true dark logo (the dark
  files were copies of the light artwork). The dark SVGs and PNGs are now a
  recolor of the light artwork with the dark teal `#00657C` swapped for the
  bright teal `#1DA8C6` (the dark-mode `--teal`), so the wordmark/mark read on
  dark backgrounds. Coral/yellow are unchanged.
